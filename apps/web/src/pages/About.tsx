    hi, Iâ€™m Amanda, Amanda Davis, Founder I was born and raised in Northern
    California, and my passion for animals is something I've had for as long as
    I can remember. As a child, I watched Animal Precinct, a TV show about the
    ASPCA's Humane Law Enforcement, and I knew I wanted to help animals in need
    just like they did. My strong love for animal welfare was well known. In
    2018, when the Northern California fires occurred, I started the
    @norcalwildfirelostandfoundpets account to reunite lost and found pets
    affected by the fires. It was then that I realized I could make a difference
    through networking on my phone, all while running my own business! When 2020
    arrived and we were all confined to our homes, I did what many people did: I
    got a dog. I didn't know much about English bulldogs, but one in particular
    caught my eye. A few weeks later, that adorable puppy was mine and I named
    her Love. The moment we met, she filled a part of my heart I didn't know was
    empty. Over the next year and a half, I watched as my puppy simultaneously
    grew and deteriorated. The pain and uncertainty were unbearable, as no one
    could diagnose her condition. She would swing between periods of being a
    perfectly normal puppy and times when her life was in doubt. She developed
    life-threatening pneumonia every few months and had unexplained infections
    in different parts of her body. Despite the hardships, I would have done
    anything to keep her alive. After a partial lung removal, she passed away,
    taking a piece of me with her. When I learned about the crisis in our animal
    shelters, I thought about how hard I had tried to keep Love alive. These
    shelters were euthanizing perfectly healthy, adoptable dogs by the
    thousands. I realized that these dogs deserved as much of a chance to live
    as Love did, and if nobody else would fight for them, I would! Thus, Love's
    Legacy Rescue was born. In honor of Love Davis February 11, 2020 - July 19,
